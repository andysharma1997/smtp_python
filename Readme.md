# SMTP Service With Python
This is the python project that lets you send email with you gmail account and also addresses some problems that can arise with an SMTP service with gmail.

### Things to note

1. Never use your personal email for this as you will have to lower the security setting in gmail. So it is advisable to create a test email-id
2. Lower the security setting of the gmail by disabling the [two-step verification](https://myaccount.google.com/)
3. Allow [less secure app setting](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) to ON
4. Try sending the email with the service and still if smtp authentication error shows up, [click here](https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha) change the /b/0/ in the URL to the account number of you browser.
